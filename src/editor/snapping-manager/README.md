# SnappingManager

`SnappingManager` finds guides and coordinates both verified and legacy snapping paths. Migrated interactions publish guides only after the object reaches them, while legacy interactions keep their existing calculated-guide contract. Canonical dimensions of composite objects remain the responsibility of the manager that owns the corresponding object type.

The two-phase contract is currently used when scaling a regular top-level shape, when moving a standalone top-level `FabricImage`, top-level shape, standalone top-level `Textbox`, eligible `ActiveSelection`, or direct top-level `Group`, when scaling a supported top-level `FabricImage`, image-only `ActiveSelection`, shape-only `ActiveSelection`, text-driven `ActiveSelection` with optional canonical direct images, or the full image, shape, and text composition, when changing the width of a supported standalone top-level `BackgroundTextbox` through either side control, and when scaling that text through any standard corner control. Movement of `CropFrame`, nested objects, and ineligible `ActiveSelection` compositions still uses the legacy path. Unsupported image, text, and selection geometries are not routed through a migrated owner. The exact migration boundary and the recommended order for continuing the work are documented in [`technical-specifications/unified-scale-snapping-current-state.md`](../../../technical-specifications/unified-scale-snapping-current-state.md).

## Responsibilities

- [`scaling/scale-snap-candidates.ts`](./scaling/scale-snap-candidates.ts) captures exact snap targets at the start of a gesture. The active object and its descendants are excluded from this snapshot.
- [`scaling/scale-snapping-resolver.ts`](./scaling/scale-snapping-resolver.ts) selects reachable guides, maintains independent hold states for the X and Y axes, and preserves candidates that a domain owner may refine against measured geometry. It does not mutate the canvas.
- [`scaling/scale-projection.ts`](./scaling/scale-projection.ts) describes the local relationship between canonical size parameters and object edges and solves one or two compatible guide constraints.
- [`scaling/scale-snapping-runtime.ts`](./scaling/scale-snapping-runtime.ts) connects raw pointer intent, mutation-free resolution, optional domain refinement, and verification of the geometry that was actually applied.
- [`scaling/rectangular-scale-gesture-projection.ts`](./scaling/rectangular-scale-gesture-projection.ts) captures and projects the immutable geometry of all eight standard side and corner controls for a top-level rectangular scale gesture without skew or flip. It is shared by Shape, Image, and standalone text, but contains no domain layout or materialization policy.
- [`scaling/rectangular-scale-interaction.ts`](./scaling/rectangular-scale-interaction.ts) selects the current Fabric scale mode or accepts an explicit mode from the domain control, resolves preview or pointer multipliers, applies one scale plan around the fixed scene point, and reads the exact final geometry. The single-image and supported selection owners share these operations while keeping their eligibility and protected-state rules separate.
- [`scaling/standard-scale-control.ts`](./scaling/standard-scale-control.ts) verifies that a Fabric control keeps the standard rectangular scale action and detects a side control switching to skew. Image and supported selection owners share this compatibility boundary; ShapeManager explicitly identifies its custom corner controls separately.
- [`movement/movement-snap-candidates.ts`](./movement/movement-snap-candidates.ts) creates line targets with stable identities for the lifetime of a gesture and separates ordinary objects from montage bounds used only for line snapping.
- [`movement/movement-snapping-resolver.ts`](./movement/movement-snapping-resolver.ts) selects one line or equal-spacing constraint per axis, preserves the selected constraint through its release zone, coordinates exact correction and verification, falls back to a line from the same raw intent when the primary interval is lost, and handles Ctrl and pixel rounding without mutating Fabric objects.
- [`movement/spacing-patterns.ts`](./movement/spacing-patterns.ts) finds exact intervals between neighbouring named objects while preserving the identities at both ends of each interval.
- [`movement/spacing-chains.ts`](./movement/spacing-chains.ts) builds complete logical chains from the full gesture snapshot, including the active object. It accepts only intervals whose exact spread is at most `0.001`, whose display values match, and whose objects share one perpendicular corridor.
- [`movement/movement-spacing-correction.ts`](./movement/movement-spacing-correction.ts) keeps exact correction separate from display rounding. An object that already belonged to a logical chain at `mousedown` returns to its initial position on the constrained axis, while a new isolated interval continues to use the selected exact neighbours or reference interval.
- [`movement/movement-spacing-verification.ts`](./movement/movement-spacing-verification.ts) verifies the selected intervals against the final bounds and builds guides for every interval of a confirmed logical chain.
- [`movement/movement-snapping-runtime.ts`](./movement/movement-snapping-runtime.ts) gives one movement plan to each native pointer marker and updates line and spacing hold state only after verification.
- [`movement/movement-snapping-controller.ts`](./movement/movement-snapping-controller.ts) captures an immutable movement session and applies one final Fabric translation for standalone top-level images, top-level shapes, standalone top-level `Textbox` objects, eligible `ActiveSelection` compositions, and direct top-level `Group` objects. Unsupported targets are deliberately routed to the legacy movement path.
- [`scaling/image-scale-snapping-controller.ts`](./scaling/image-scale-snapping-controller.ts) owns supported scale sessions for a top-level `FabricImage`, applies both resolved scale factors once around the fixed scene point, and returns only guides verified against the exact final bounds.
- [`../selection-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-interaction-controller.ts`](../selection-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-interaction-controller.ts) owns supported scale sessions for an `ActiveSelection` made only of direct images, only of canonical direct shapes, of supported standalone text objects with optional canonical direct images, or of the full image, shape, and text composition. It applies one plan to the temporary selection and delegates shape constraints or text-driven measurement without starting a second snapping session.
- [`../selection-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-session.ts`](../selection-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-session.ts) validates the gesture, captures its immutable baseline and protected state, and starts the shared snapping and domain sessions atomically.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-measurer.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-measurer.ts) measures every text child on a detached object, projects direct images from the same immutable baseline, combines the strictest text limits, and returns the exact child geometry and resulting selection frame.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-plan.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/active-selection-scale-plan.ts) refines selected guides against nonlinear text wrapping and preserves the unconstrained pointer axis during free corner scaling.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/active-selection-scaling-controller.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/active-selection-scaling-controller.ts) owns the text-specific session, applies one measured state to the live children, and commits them with unit scale.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-width-resize-interaction-controller.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-width-resize-interaction-controller.ts) owns supported side-width interactions for standalone text and applies one canonical width around the fixed scene point.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-width-resize-measurer.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-width-resize-measurer.ts) measures wrapping on a detached `BackgroundTextbox`, so candidate refinement does not mutate the live object.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-width-resize-plan.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-width-resize-plan.ts) refines a selected guide when wrapping changes the relationship between canonical width and the visible bounds.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-interaction-controller.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-interaction-controller.ts) owns supported corner-scale interactions for standalone text, deduplicates Fabric events, applies one canonical result, and verifies each reached axis independently.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-measurer.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-measurer.ts) measures proportional text scaling on a detached `BackgroundTextbox`, including canonical width, font size, padding, corner radii, and wrapping.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-plan.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-plan.ts) refines the selected candidates against measured text geometry. It prefers a compatible pair, keeps any guide already reached by the measured result, and then tries each axis independently without repeatedly mutating the live object.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-projection.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-corner-scale-projection.ts) maps the four standard corner controls to their moving edges and fixed scene point for regular, rotated, and centred gestures.
- [`../text-manager/scaling/text-scaling.ts`](../text-manager/scaling/text-scaling.ts) remains the owner that materializes the measured width, font size, padding, and corner radii and restores canonical text scale.
- [`movement/line-snapping.ts`](./movement/line-snapping.ts) resolves ordinary line snapping for movement targets that have not yet been migrated.
- [`movement/spacing.ts`](./movement/spacing.ts) resolves equal spacing and returns every selected interval with its exact nearest-neighbour or reference-pattern identity, whether it is primary or related, and the segment to render.
- [`scaling/legacy-scale-snapping.ts`](./scaling/legacy-scale-snapping.ts) and [`pixel-grid.ts`](./pixel-grid.ts) support resize scenarios that have not yet been migrated, including `CropFrame`.
- [`guides/snap-target-resolver.ts`](./guides/snap-target-resolver.ts) selects available snap targets in canvas order and resolves their exact or rounded bounds while preserving exact source bounds for an active crop frame.
- [`guides/renderer.ts`](./guides/renderer.ts) owns drawing line and spacing guides and calculating fallback viewport bounds.
- [`index.ts`](./index.ts) routes gestures to migrated or legacy owners, creates the shared rectangular scale projection and snapping session, publishes verified guides, owns terminal cleanup, and preserves the old handling for object types that have not moved to the new contract.
- [`../utils/geometry.ts`](../utils/geometry.ts) returns exact object bounds in scene coordinates and separately provides the rounded representation required by legacy code.

## Contract for a single migrated interaction step

```text
gesture-start state
  → pointer intent
  → mutation-free snap resolution
  → one application by the current domain or Fabric owner
  → verification of the actual bounds
  → guide publication
```

The following rules are mandatory:

- every new `mousemove` is resolved from the state captured on `mousedown`, not from the result of the previous snapped step;
- in migrated scaling paths, `object:scaling` and the following `mouse:move` with the same `event.e` represent one step;
- a guide remains held until the raw pointer intent crosses the release threshold;
- when both axes are available, acquiring or releasing one guide must not reset the other;
- rounding must not move an edge that is already constrained by a guide;
- a guide is published only after the exact bounds of the applied result have been verified;
- `mouseup` must not change the last visible state.

Each spacing plan keeps the exact before and after neighbours and the reference interval selected from the immutable gesture snapshot. Applicability is checked after X and Y corrections are combined and again against the final bounds. A logical chain is rendered only when it already contained the active object at `mousedown` and the object remains inside the current acquire or release threshold. Losing the primary interval rejects the spacing constraint and lets the same raw intent acquire a line instead.

## ShapeManager integration

For a regular shape, the geometry snapshot is captured on `mousedown`. `ShapeManager` resolves the active control mode and remains the sole owner of minimum size, layout, text wrapping, and canonical dimension commits. `SnappingManager` provides the resolved constraints and verifies the resulting bounds after they have been applied.

The new path supports side and corner controls, rotation, centred scaling, free corner scaling with Shift, and disabling snapping with Ctrl. Skewed, flipped, nested, or axis-locked shapes use the legacy path. A supported gesture that later crosses the fixed point may hand the remaining live interaction back to the legacy path after earlier unified steps have already been applied.

Gesture state is cleared on `mouseup`, selection changes, object removal, `pointercancel`, `touchcancel`, window blur, and manager destruction.

## Image, shape, standalone text, ActiveSelection, and Group movement integration

For a standalone top-level image, top-level shape, standalone top-level `Textbox`, eligible `ActiveSelection`, or direct top-level `Group`, `mousedown` captures exact initial bounds, Fabric `left/top`, zoom, named line candidates, and a full equal-spacing snapshot that includes the active object. Every `object:moving` step reads the raw Fabric result, resolves line and equal-spacing hold state independently by axis, includes pixel rounding in the same final position, applies at most one post-Fabric translation, and verifies the resulting exact bounds before publishing guides.

Exact correction and the displayed distance are deliberately separate. Centred placement and a newly acquired reference interval use exact scene bounds without quantizing the correction to a half-pixel step. An existing chain is accepted only when the spread between its minimum and maximum exact intervals is at most `0.001` scene pixels, every interval resolves to the same display value, and every object intersects one shared perpendicular corridor. The representative distance is then calculated from the complete chain, and every guide uses the shared display value and the centre of the common corridor. These rules are identical for horizontal and vertical chains.

Template application preserves exact fractional geometry, so a template with three intervals of `47.25` scene pixels remains `47.25 / 47.25 / 47.25`. Equal-spacing guides and Alt measurement read those same actual intervals and both display `47`. A `47 / 48 / 47` layout is not an equal-spacing chain even though some values may look close after rounding. If template content ever needs bulk pixel alignment, TemplateManager must use a group-level algorithm that explicitly preserves relative distances, anchors, and outer bounds instead of snapping each object independently.

When the active object already belongs to a confirmed chain at `mousedown`, snapping restores its initial position on the constrained axis instead of rewriting one interval from an active-dependent local reference. The complete chain therefore remains stable regardless of which object is dragged first or how later drags are ordered.

Ctrl returns the unrounded raw Fabric position and clears both line and spacing hold state. A repeated native marker reuses its verified result without reading or changing the target again. A new `mousedown` first ends the previous movement session and clears visible guides and legacy anchor caches before the new snapshot and anchors are captured. The movement session and visible guides are also cleared on `mouseup`, selection changes, removal of the active target or a direct child of the active `ActiveSelection`, `pointercancel`, `touchcancel`, window blur, and manager destruction.

Shape movement remains a plain Fabric translation: it does not run shape layout, change canonical dimensions, or alter the embedded text. On a drag `object:modified` event, ShapeManager still performs its normal interaction cleanup but skips scale materialization because a move must not reinterpret pre-existing `scaleX/scaleY` as a resize. Standalone text movement is also a plain Fabric translation and does not change its text, dimensions, font size, padding, corner radii, angle, or scale factors. The regular Fabric history lifecycle commits both completed drag types without an additional save from their domain managers.

An eligible `ActiveSelection` contains at least two direct top-level children, and every child is a `FabricImage`, shape, or standalone `Textbox` without a previous `parent`. If the selection contains standalone text, the selection itself must have `scaleX` and `scaleY` equal to `1`; otherwise the existing text finalization path could reinterpret movement as unfinished scaling. An image-only selection may retain non-unit selection scale after its existing scale lifecycle, and movement preserves that scale together with every child's local geometry. The selection itself receives one Fabric translation, while direct children keep their local position, dimensions, scale, angle, and relative placement. Those children are excluded from snap candidates, so the selection cannot snap to itself.

A direct top-level `Group` receives the same single root `left/top` translation regardless of its child composition, rotation, flip, skew, or accumulated scale. The persisted root properties and nested `objects` hierarchy remain intact; each child keeps its local position, dimensions, scale, and angle, while every child world bound receives the same scene-space delta. Group children are not top-level canvas candidates, and the root itself is excluded from the gesture snapshot, so the group cannot snap to its own contents. The regular Fabric lifecycle commits one history entry, while clipboard and template restoration preserve one root group with fresh recursive identities.

An `ActiveSelection` containing `Group`, `CropFrame`, an object selected out of a parent group, an unknown type, or non-canonical text scaling is deliberately left on the legacy path. A nested `Group` is also excluded by the same top-level boundary.

This phase intentionally handles only an active browser drag of a top-level `FabricImage`, top-level shape, standalone top-level `Textbox`, eligible `ActiveSelection`, or direct top-level `Group`. Movement without an active browser gesture, nested objects, `CropFrame`, and ineligible `ActiveSelection` compositions continue through the legacy path.

## Image scale integration

For a supported top-level image, `mousedown` captures exact bounds, the original Fabric scale, the fixed scene point, immutable candidates, zoom, the selected control, and the control origin. The shared rectangular projection handles `ml`, `mr`, `mt`, `mb`, `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, and `br`, including rotated and centred gestures. Corner scaling follows the current Fabric `uniformScaling` and `uniScaleKey` settings, so the controller preserves Fabric's real uniform/free mode instead of assigning product meaning directly to Shift.

Each `object:scaling` step reads the raw scale already calculated by the standard Fabric control. If Fabric does not publish that transform event for a new native marker, the following `mouse:move` projects the pointer from the same immutable baseline. A repeated marker reuses the verified result without another target read, mutation, or guide publication. If a side modifier switches Fabric from scaling to skew during the gesture, the controller ends the unified session, clears its scale guides, and does not apply legacy scaling over Fabric's skew result.

The scale runtime holds vertical and horizontal constraints independently. The controller applies the resolved `scaleX` and `scaleY` once, updates the active Fabric transform from the scale values actually accepted by the target, restores the fixed scene point, and then verifies exact bounds, reached guides, canonical `width` and `height`, crop offsets, inactive scale state, and affine state. This keeps the transform synchronized when Fabric applies constraints such as `minScaleLimit`. Guides are published only after this verification. Ctrl clears held constraints and applies raw intent, zoom and pan stay at the scene-coordinate boundary, and `mouseup` preserves the last live geometry while clearing transient guides.

The supported boundary is a positive-scale, top-level `FabricImage` using one of the eight standard matching scale actions, with no skew, flip, or locked scale axis. An ordinary stroke whose width scales with the image is supported. Visual control overrides such as rendering, cursor, and size preserve the standard interaction contract and remain supported. A nested image, `Group`, control with custom scale behaviour or geometry, custom transform action, skewed or flipped image, axis-locked image, scale-independent nonzero stroke, or a gesture that crosses its fixed point stays on or returns to the legacy path. Scaling an image-only `ActiveSelection` is supported by `SelectionManager` as a separate composite interaction; it is not routed through the single-image controller. Shape-specific eligibility, stabilization, minimum size, text layout, and canonical materialization remain in `ShapeManager`.

## Supported ActiveSelection scale integration

`SelectionManager` owns the migrated scale session for an `ActiveSelection` containing at least two direct images, at least two direct canonical shape groups, a supported standalone text with another supported text or image, or the full mixed composition with at least one image, one canonical unrotated shape, and one canonical standalone text. The selection must use positive scale, a supported side or corner control, and no skew, flip, parent group, lock, or locked scale axis. Compositions containing standalone text must start with unit selection scale. Supported shape and text children use canonical unit scale and zero angle, skew, and flip; text also requires zero stroke width, no path, editing, parent, lock, or locked scale axis. Images in text-driven compositions may retain positive finite scale but require zero angle, skew, flip, and stroke width, no parent, and no locked scale axis. Unknown, nested, individually rotated, noncanonical, `Group`, and `CropFrame` compositions remain on the existing snapping path.

The controller captures the exact selection bounds, fixed scene point, original selection scale, candidates, zoom, selected control, and protected child state on `mousedown`. It resolves every pointer step from that immutable baseline and publishes guides only after the applied geometry has been verified. A text-driven step and any contributed shape geometry remain pending until that common verification succeeds; failures restore the last confirmed direct snapshot without leaving partially applied domain state. For compositions containing shapes, the early `ShapeManager` listener asks the same owner to process the step immediately and falls back to the existing path only when the step is declined. `ShapeManager` remains responsible for shape layout, text wrapping, minimum size, and canonical shape commit. In the full mixed composition it supplies exact constrained shape geometry through a domain source, while `TextManager` measures standalone text, projects images from the same frame, and combines all child bounds before anything is applied. Duplicate Fabric and `mouse:move` delivery cannot apply one pointer event twice.

Image-only and shape-only selections support all eight controls. Selections containing standalone text, including the full mixed composition, support `ml`, `mr`, `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, and `br`; the vertical side controls stay hidden. Horizontal, proportional corner, Shift-controlled free corner, centred, and whole-selection rotated gestures preserve their fixed point. Hold and release are resolved independently by axis, and zoom or pan affects only scene-to-viewport conversion. The session is cleared on `mouseup`, selection changes, captured-child removal, `pointercancel`, `touchcancel`, window blur, and manager destruction. For text-driven and full mixed compositions, an interrupted or failed step restores the last confirmed geometry before the current Fabric transform is completed; a failure before the first confirmed step returns to the original geometry without committing a partial result.

During an image-only gesture, scale belongs to the temporary selection while each image keeps its local source geometry. During a shape-only gesture, accepted scale is materialized into canonical shape dimensions and text layout. During a text-driven or full mixed gesture, all text, image, and shape geometry is measured first and applied as one combined frame; no domain starts a second snapping session. For a full mixed composition, creating the replacement `ActiveSelection` is the geometry commit point. Failures before it restore the original frame and every child and release the failed Fabric transform and history action. After that point, retained state is cleared and shape lifecycle events are published from the current geometry. Finalization failures are reported through `ErrorManager` without rolling back committed geometry or interrupting the remaining Fabric and history lifecycle. One gesture creates one regular history entry, and the committed result is verified through undo, redo, copying, and template restoration.

The next migration phase is `CropFrame`. Other mixed combinations remain outside the supported boundary until their domain measurement, application, and commit contracts are explicit.

## Standalone text resize integration

For a supported standalone top-level `BackgroundTextbox`, `mousedown` captures the exact bounds, canonical width, fixed scene point, selected side control, immutable candidates, and zoom. Both `ml` and `mr` controls use the shared scale resolver and runtime. Rotated text and width changes around the centre are supported, while Ctrl clears held constraints and applies the pointer width without snapping.

Fabric recalculates text wrapping when `width` is set, so the visible edge is not always a linear function of width. The text owner first measures the pointer width on a detached `BackgroundTextbox`, lets the shared resolver select a guide, and then refines that selected plan against the measured wrapping. The live text receives one final canonical width for each pointer event while preserving the minimum width calculated for its longest unbreakable line. Continued inward movement of either side control and `mouseup` keep the same minimum geometry. The fixed point and protected text properties are restored and verified before guides are published.

The side-width session is cleared on `mouseup`, `object:modified`, selection changes, removal of the active text, `pointercancel`, `touchcancel`, window blur, and manager destruction. Directly created text, template-restored text, history restoration, and copied text follow the same supported path.

For corner scaling, `mousedown` captures the original canonical text state, exact bounds, fixed scene point, selected corner, immutable candidates, and zoom. The `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, and `br` controls use one proportional scale multiplier. A detached `BackgroundTextbox` measures the resulting width, font size, padding, corner radii, and wrapping before the live object is changed.

The resolver may select one guide or a compatible pair that can be reached by the same multiplier. TextManager applies the measured canonical result once, resets `scaleX` and `scaleY` to `1`, restores the fixed opposite point or centre, and verifies each axis against the final exact bounds. A blocked guide on one axis therefore cannot hide a guide that the text actually reached on the other axis. Rotated and centred gestures use the same path, Ctrl clears held constraints, and Shift keeps text scaling proportional. Duplicate delivery of the same native Fabric event does not materialize the text twice.

Corner-scale hold is always resolved from the immutable gesture baseline. Small pointer movements inside the hold zone keep the canonical text state and selected guides stable, and `mouseup` preserves the last live geometry while clearing transient guides.

If the pointer reaches or crosses the fixed point during a fast shrink, the text stays at its minimum canonical size without ending the migrated session. Fabric flipping is temporarily disabled for that gesture and the original setting is restored when the gesture ends. Moving the pointer back can therefore enlarge the text and acquire guides again without an intermediate `mouseup`.

Corner scaling keeps fractional canonical width and derived height instead of rounding them during the live step or on `mouseup`. The same exact geometry is restored through history, clipboard operations, and template application, including templates applied to a montage area with a different size. Legacy text interactions retain their existing dimension rounding.

`preserveExactTextGeometry` is the persisted restoration contract for this result. Successful unified corner scaling of standalone text and unified scaling of a supported text-driven selection store `true`; side-width resizing and legacy text interactions store `false`. Older serialized text without this property keeps the legacy rounding rules, and the transient `shouldRoundDimensionsOnInit` flag is never persisted.

The migrated text boundary is deliberately narrow. Side-width and corner-scale interactions require a standalone top-level `BackgroundTextbox` without a path, skew, or flip. Corner scaling additionally requires canonical `scaleX` and `scaleY`, `strokeWidth = 0`, unlocked axes, one of Fabric's standard matching corner controls, and text that is not being edited. Nested text, text owned by a shape, text on a path, editing text, locked text, nonzero stroke, and custom corner behaviour stay on the existing path.

## Geometry, distances, and MeasurementManager

- Movement, equal-spacing snapping, and `MeasurementManager` use `getObjectExactBounds()`. All compared edges are expressed in scene coordinates, and centres are derived from those same bounds.
- Custom exact bounds must contain finite, ordered values. Invalid geometry fails before guides are resolved or rendered.
- An isolated equal-spacing guide stores the actual bounds of both gaps. A verified logical chain stores every neighbouring interval, accepts only a technical exact-distance error of at most `0.001`, and uses the same display value as Alt measurement for the same geometry.
- `resolveDisplayDistance()` rounds finite values only. Negative distances become zero, while `NaN` and `Infinity` are treated as contract violations.

## CropFrame on the legacy path

`CropFrame` geometry is expressed in canvas coordinates, while the resulting crop size may be calculated in source-image pixels. These values must not be compared without an explicit conversion.

Until `CropFrame` is migrated:

- `getObjectSnappingBounds()` returns the frame bounds on the canvas;
- `getObjectDisplaySize()` may return the resulting size through `cropSourceScaleX/Y`;
- `shouldUseUniformScaleSnap()` mirrors the `preserveAspectRatio` rule, including its Shift inversion;
- during movement with `allowFrameOverflow = false`, source overflow is resolved per axis: snapping is disabled only on the axis that will be clamped, while a guide reached by movement on the other axis remains active;
- when proportional scaling crosses a source-image boundary, the plan is delegated to `CropManager.applyFrameSourceBoundScalePlan()`;
- free scaling remains subject to per-axis constraints in `crop-controls.ts` and final verification in `CropManager._clampFrameIfNeeded()`.

These formulas must not be moved into the shared resolver. `CropManager` must apply source-image constraints once and return the actual bounds for shared verification.

## Before making the next change

- First identify where the defect lives: target selection, guide holding, domain application, result verification, or rendering.
- For a new object type, start with one real browser regression and then connect its owner to the shared runtime.
- Do not consider movement migrated because one test is green. Cover line and equal-spacing hold, independent axis release, Ctrl, rotation, zoom and pan, `mouseup`, history, and gesture interruption paths.
- Do not consider scaling migrated because one control is green. Cover every supported side and corner control, rotation, Ctrl and Shift where they affect the domain, repeated pointer positions, `mouseup`, history, and gesture interruption paths.
- Image scale is complete for the supported top-level `FabricImage` boundary. Scaling `ActiveSelection` is complete for image-only, shape-only, text-only, image-and-text, and full image-shape-text compositions within their documented canonical boundaries. Movement is complete for top-level images, shapes, standalone `Textbox` objects, eligible `ActiveSelection` compositions, and direct top-level `Group` objects. Side-width resizing and corner scaling are complete for the supported standalone text boundary. The next scale migration stage is the `CropFrame` interaction owner.
- Before changing `CropFrame`, reread [`../crop-manager/README.md`](../crop-manager/README.md), [`scaling/legacy-scale-snapping.ts`](./scaling/legacy-scale-snapping.ts), [`pixel-grid.ts`](./pixel-grid.ts), and [`../crop-manager/domain/crop-frame.ts`](../crop-manager/domain/crop-frame.ts).
